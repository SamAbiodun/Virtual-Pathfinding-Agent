# Virtual Pathfinding Agent
I completed a project that involved designing and building a simulation in a virtual environment. The simulation included an intelligent virtual agent that could plan routes through the environment using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The virtual agent's starting point and multiple endpoints could be set.

To develop this project, I utilized the Unity engine and C# programming language. The project allowed me to improve my skills in Unity development and C# programming, as well as explore the possibilities of AI in virtual environments. The end result was a realistic and functional simulation that allowed the virtual agent to successfully navigate through the environment using the planned routes.
